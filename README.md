 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System (ML Web App)

A web-based Machine Learning application built using **Python and Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on key medical parameters. The application provides a clean, modern, and interactive user interface with a glassmorphism design and background blur effects.

📌 Project Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction System** uses a trained Machine Learning classification model to analyze medical inputs such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, and age, and predicts whether a person is diabetic or not.

This project is designed as an **end-to-end ML application**, combining:
- Model loading
- User input handling
- Real-time prediction
- Professional UI styling

 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Machine Learning–based diabetes prediction  
- 🖥️ Interactive web interface using Streamlit  
- 🎨 Modern glassmorphism UI with background blur  
- 📊 Clear and color-coded prediction results  
- ⚡ Instant predictions with a single click  
- 📱 Responsive and easy-to-use layout  

🧪 Input Parameters

The model takes the following medical inputs:

- Number of Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin Level  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

 🧠 How the App Works

1. The user enters medical details through the web interface.
2. These inputs are converted into a numerical format.
3. The trained Machine Learning model processes the input data.
4. The model analyzes patterns learned from historical medical data.
5. The application displays whether the person is **diabetic or not** instantly.
